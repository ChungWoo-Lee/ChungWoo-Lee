**Depth Estimation Performance Metrics**
===
This repository contains an overview of performance metrics commonly used for evaluating depth estimation models.
Performance Metrics

> **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**

* Measures the average absolute difference between predicted and ground truth depth values.

> **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

* Calculates the average squared difference between predicted and ground truth depth values.

> **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

* The square root of MSE, providing an interpretable metric in the same units as the data.

> Log Scale RMSE

* Applies logarithm to the depth values before calculating RMSE, enhancing robustness to outliers and facilitating relative comparisons.

> Accuracy Under Threshold

* Determines the accuracy of predictions by comparing the ratio between predicted and actual depths against a threshold value.
